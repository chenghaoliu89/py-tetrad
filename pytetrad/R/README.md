## Py-Tetrad in RStudio

This project is being offered is a possible way of connecting Tetrad to R which we are trying out. If it turns out to be useful, we will develop it; if not, we will pursue a different route. It is intended to replace the older [r-causal](https://github.com/bd2kccd/r-causal) Python project, which uses an outdated version of Tetrad from many years ago.

Here are [INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad/blob/main/pytetrad/R/INSTALLATION.md).

Here is some [INITIAL DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad/blob/main/pytetrad/R/DOCUMENTATION.md).

If you have questions or need more (or different) functionality, or are just flummoxed by the installation procedure or output graph format, [let us know](https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad/issues). This R functionality is new as of 2023-04-04, so feedback is very welcome. We'd like to make this useful for the R community and will put some effort into making that happen.
